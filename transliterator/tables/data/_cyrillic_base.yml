    copied from Russian .cfg file and stripped

    has been left here on purpose, assuming it's valid

    # NOTE There is ambiguity about ignoring these
    # words. Note that the single-character Roman
    # numerals are not included on purpose.
    # Ideally the source editors should use the
    # dedicated U+2160÷U+216F (uppercase Roman
    # numerals) and/or U+2170÷U+217F (lower case Roman
    # numerals) ranges to avoid this ambiguity.
    # TODO implement regular expressions for ignore patterns.
